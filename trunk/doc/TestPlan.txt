Things To Do:

1. In test_point2d.py:
    test == and != for:
        [x] plain numbers
        [x] lists vs lists
        [x] tuples vs tuples
        [x] point2ds vs point2ds
        
        Note: == and != do not work as expected between tuples and lists, so no testing of tuples vs. lists will be performed.
