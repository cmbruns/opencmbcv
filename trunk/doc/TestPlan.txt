Things To Do:

1. In test_point2d.py:
    test == and != for:
        [x] plain numbers
        [ ] lists vs lists
        [ ] tuples vs tuples
        [ ] point2ds vs point2ds
        
        Note: == and != do not work as expected between tuples and lists, so no testing of tuples vs. lists will be performed.
